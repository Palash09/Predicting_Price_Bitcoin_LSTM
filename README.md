# Predicting_Price_Bitcoin_LSTM
This repository consists of python code for predicting the prices of Bitcoin by using LSTM which is built using tensorflow library.

By using tensorflow library, I have built a model for predicting the price of bitcoin based on the previous records. I have 
implemented recurrent neural network for this, as it facilitates time series prediction which was required in this situation.
Apart from tensorflow, I have also used keras for performing some of the basic tasks which were required before getting the final
results.
